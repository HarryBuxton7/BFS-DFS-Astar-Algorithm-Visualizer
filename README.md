Made in an hour using mostly chatGPT. Visualises A* search algorithm vs breadth first search then highlights a path.
I don't know the full details on how the code implements each step because i didn't write it, but I had to make the grid first then the algorithm visualizer then edit a bit to put the thing together.
But I still didn't have to read the code for the algorithm implementations because they just worked instantly.
Mainly an example of how useful chatGPT can be for generating code/proof of concept for how to do things at the start of a project.
Used chat gpt 4
