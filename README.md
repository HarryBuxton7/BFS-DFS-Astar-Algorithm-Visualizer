Made in an hour using mostly chatGPT. Visualises A* search algorithm vs breadth first search then highlights a path. Allows you to choose the grid size and draw in a start node and goal node in the grid and wall, which the alogirthm has to navigate in order to reach the goal node. The program then outputs if it is successful in reaching the node and highlights a path.

I don't know the full details on how the code implements each step because i didn't write it, but I had to make the grid first then the algorithm visualizer then edit a bit to put the thing together.
But I still didn't have to read the code for the algorithm implementations because they just worked instantly.
Mainly an example of how useful chatGPT can be for generating code/proof of concept for how to do things at the start of a project.
Used chat gpt 4

Chat GPT has clear limitations and moving this project any futher would not be possible without humans writing maintable code. So it's clear this is very limited, but interesting none the less.
